Google has announced that, starting in 2026/2027, all apps on certified Android devices
will require the developer to submit personal identity details directly to Google.
Since the developers of this app do not agree to this requirement, this app will no longer 
work on certified Android devices after that time.

# Voice recognition based on Whisper

Whisper is an input method editor (IME) that leverages voice recognition technology based on the Whisper engine. 
It offers a seamless user experience, functioning both as a standalone application and an integrated IME that can be activated, e.g. via the microphone button in HeliBoard.
As a standalone app Whisper can also translate any supported language to English.

Besides providing an IME, whisper can also be selected as system-wide voice input (RecognitionService) and it supports calls via intent (RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH).

## Initial Setup

Upon launching Whisper for the first time, the app will download the necessary Whisper models (~435 MB) from Hugging Face. 
Please note that this is the only instance where internet permission is required. 
Once the models are downloaded, voice recognition works entirely offline, ensuring your privacy and convenience.

Please note that for use as voice input (not as IME) there is a separate settings activity which can be accessed from Android settings 
(System > Languages > Speech > Voice Input). There you can activate the app as voice input and then click the settings button.
In settings you can then select the model for voice input.

If after installation you do not find Whisper as voice input or only see a limited list (hard-coded ones like Google/Samsung)
- enable USB debugging
- type adb shell settings put secure voice_recognition_service org.woheller69.whisper/com.whispertflite.WhisperRecognitionService

## Model Selection

Whisper offers two models to choose from: a compact English-only model that prioritizes speed and a more comprehensive multi-lingual model that, while much slower, 
supports a broader range of languages. Select your preferred model within the app, and it will be applied consistently across all uses, including when used as an IME.

## Using Whisper

To get the most out of Whisper, follow these simple tips:

- Tap the button to start and stop recording, or press and hold it while speaking. Automatic mode is available too
- Pause briefly before starting to speak
- Speak clearly, loudly, and at a moderate pace
- Recordings can be up to 5 minutes long. Whisper processes 30 s at a time, so longer recordings are transcribed in chunks

By following these guidelines, you'll be able to enjoy accurate and efficient voice recognition with Whisper.

## Floating microphone

A floating microphone button appears when you edit a text field in any app. Tap it to dictate and insert the text into that field without switching keyboards. You can drag the button to either edge of the screen.

Enable it in the app ("Floating mic button"), which opens the Accessibility settings. On Android 13+ you may first have to allow "restricted settings" for the app (App info → ⋮ menu).

Why it is an accessibility service: Android lets apps use the microphone in the background and insert text into other apps only in a few cases. An accessibility service is the only reliable one. It is used only to:
- find out whether a text field has focus, so the button can be shown,
- insert the transcription into the focused field.

It does not read or store screen content. Audio is processed on the device and never leaves it. The button is hidden in password fields, and dictated text is never placed in the clipboard for them.

## Custom words

Whisper models sometimes misspell names and technical terms (e.g. "Helena" instead of "Elena", "cloud code" instead of "Claude Code"). Under "Custom words…" you can add one entry per line:
- `Elena`: words that sound alike are corrected to it. This applies to entries with at least 5 letters and to acronyms like `GPT`. Shorter entries only fix upper/lower case.
- `cloud code = Claude Code`: explicit replacement.

The corrections apply to the floating microphone, the keyboard, the app and the system voice input.
